The group project to present to the class in bootcamp on Friday April 19, 2024.
Welcome to the Wild Wild Wellness!
If you are looking to get fit and know what diet you are looking for, this is the place for you!

# What is your goal?

Pick out any of the exercises you want to work on based on what part of the body you want to build strength on. You will see what is the most effective routine that will work that section of the body. While you are here, you can also find out what food diets you are looking for based on what you are looking to do to stay healthy. Such as lose fat, build muscle, build endurance, etc.

# What is the motivation?

We provide you with the best advice you are looking for to have fun with the exercises as well as staying determined on your journey to your goals! You can also get a chance to see some exercises in action to see how to do them after you have chosen an option you want to focus on! We also provide you visuals of food that you would love to eat while maintaining a healthy diet!
